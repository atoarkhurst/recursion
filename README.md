# Fibonacci and Merge Sort

This project contains implementations of Fibonacci sequence generation (iterative and recursive) and Merge Sort algorithms in JavaScript.

## Files

### `fibonacci.js`
- **`fibs(n)`** — Iterative Fibonacci implementation that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
- **`fibsRec(n)`** — Recursive Fibonacci implementation that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

### `mergesort.js`
- **`mergeSort(arr)`** — Recursive Merge Sort implementation that sorts an array of numbers.
- **`merge(arr1, arr2)`** — Helper function to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

## How to Run

1. **Install Node.js**  
   Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

2. **Run the files**  
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the scripts. Execute the following commands to run each file:

   ```bash
   node fibonacci.js
   node mergesort.js
